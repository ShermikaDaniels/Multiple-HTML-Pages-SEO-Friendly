      Front-end developer from Charleston, South Carolina
    </h3>
    <div class="about-paragraphs text-center">
      <p>
        My name is Shermika Daniels, I live in South Carolina, Which is a state
        located in the United States. I live the city of Charleston which is
        popluar for it's historic Downtown area. I have a husband, a dog, and I
        live in a house in the "suburbs", or what's considered the suburbs.
        There aren't really large cities in South Carolina, especially
        Charlestion. My favorate hobbies inclued going on vacation, I love going
        on vacation but who doesn't? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and I like reading and learning new
        skills. I also love some me time on the weekends like binge watching TV
        shows. Sometimes a mental check out is helpful in preventing burnout.
        <br />
        <br />
        I actually live in the city of Summerville, South Carolina but when you
        go out of state people usually identify mostly with charleston so we
        usually will tell people who ask that we are from Charlestion, SC.
      </p>
      <p>
        I currently have a career in cyber security with a company called
        PhishLabs by Fortra but I would like to start my career in software
        engineering. I am a cyber security trianing specialist. I create false
        phishing emails and send them out and see who falls for them. I also
        create landing pages, landing pages are the "oops you click on the
        phish" pages you see after you clicked on a simulation email. So there
        is some HTML, CSS, and Javascript that goes into this job.
        <br />
        <br />
        I really enjoy working on the SheCodes workshops and learning new
        skills. I am really excited to apply these skills in a new career path.
        So far we have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, API,
        GitHub, Bootstrap, Hosting, and Flexbox.
